# Cherry-Blossom-in-London-using-Tableau-Public

This project focuses on **visualizing cherry blossom statistics in London** using **Tableau Public**. The dataset includes information on the **number of cherry blossoms, their flowering periods, colors, and distribution across different districts in London**.

The project consists of **interactive Tableau Public visualizations** that present key insights in an engaging manner.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created the following **visualizations** in Tableau Public:

- **Stacked Bar Chart (Flowering Periods)**: Displays the distribution of cherry blossoms based on their flowering periods.
- **Stacked Bar Chart (Flower Colors)**: Represents the number of cherry blossoms categorized by their flower colors.
- **Bubble Chart (District Distribution)**: Visualizes the number of cherry blossoms across different districts in London.

## Visualizations

### 1. **Flowering Period Stacked Bar Chart**
- Displays the number of cherry blossoms blooming during each period.
- Helps identify peak flowering seasons across different districts.

### 2. **Flower Color Stacked Bar Chart**
- Shows the distribution of cherry blossom colors across different months.
- Highlights variations in flower colors across different locations.

### 3. **Bubble Chart (Cherry Blossom Distribution by District)**
- Visualizes the concentration of cherry blossoms across London districts.
- Uses **bubble size** to represent the number of cherry blossoms in each district.
